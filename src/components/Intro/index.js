            To use it, all you need to do is set up your monthly{" "}
            <strong>budgets</strong> for things like groceries and rent, and
            then start tracking your daily <strong>expenses</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using clean and simple visualizations, the app will then help you
            understand how much you spend and on what, along with how much you
            can save every month. We donâ€™t care about your income, net worth, or
            credit; there are better apps for tracking those.
